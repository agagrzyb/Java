  <h1>Unobstrusive events with DOMContentLoaded</h1>
  <p>Click anywhere on the orange wrapper to log hello in the console (F12).</p>
  <p>Use any of the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp">
  HTML DOM Events</a>, just ensure not to use the "on" prefix. For example, 
  use "click" instead of "onclick" when specifying the event guide.</p>
  <h2>JS11 vs JS12</h2>
  <p>JS11 still requires to invoke a function ("addEvents()") after the document 
  completely loaded. In JS12 we added an event listener to watch out for the 
  "document completely loaded" state and add all event listeners as soon as 
  this stage has been reached.</p>
  <h2>DOMContentLoaded vs load</h2>
  <p>The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the document has been completely 
  loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to 
  finish loading (the load event can be used to detect a fully-loaded page).</p>
